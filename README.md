# Reservation Website with Framer Motion

## Technologies Used
This project showcases a booking website I built using Framer Motion, a powerful React animation library, following The Net Ninja's tutorial. I gained expertise in smoothly animating UI elements, applying variations for dynamic effects, creating interactive hover animations, implementing SVG graphics for visual appeal, and enhancing user experiences through modals and route animations. Through the tutorial's guidance, I harnessed Framer Motion's capabilities to craft an engaging and visually stunning user interface.
