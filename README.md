### Welcome
Welcome to [Framer Motion Reservation Website](https://framer-motion-reservation.netlify.app)! Feel free to explore my website!

### Overview
The Framer Motion Reservation Website is a showcase of the potential of Framer Motion in creating seamless and delightful animations. Here's an overview of the key features of this project:  
Interactive Animations: The website is designed to provide an interactive experience through captivating animations and transitions. Framer Motion's capabilities bring the website to life with fluid and visually appealing effects.   
User Engagement: With carefully designed animations, the website aims to engage users in a unique and enjoyable way, enhancing the overall user experience.  
Responsive Design: The project incorporates responsive design principles to ensure that the animations remain effective and visually stunning across various screen sizes.  

## Technologies
Dynamic Effects: By incorporating variations in animations, I created dynamic effects that add depth and engagement to the user interface. These dynamic effects capture users' attention and elevate their interaction with the website.  
Interactive Hover Animations: I implemented interactive hover animations that respond dynamically to user actions. These animations not only provide visual feedback but also make the user experience more engaging and delightful.  
SVG Graphics for Visual Appeal: The project integrates SVG graphics, leveraging their scalability and versatility to enhance the website's visual appeal. SVGs contribute to the overall aesthetics and create an eye-catching experience.  
Modal and Route Animations: With Framer Motion, I crafted modal animations that enhance user interactions and elevate the presentation of information. Additionally, route animations provide a smooth and immersive transition between different sections of the website.
